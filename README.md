# Showtimes

Showtimes is a fansub progress tracker that exposes an API for groups to use. It goes alongside [ARX-7](https://github.com/IanMitchell/ARX-7) for usage on IRC or [Aquarius](https://github.com/IanMitchell/aquarius) on Discord. It's intended to serve multiple groups.

## Getting Access

An official showtimes server is up and running in beta form; if you'd like access, please contact me on Discord on the [Company Inc Server](http://discord.companyinc.company)

Please be aware that Showtimes isn't officially released yet, and shouldn't be considered stable.
