# Showtimes

Showtimes is a fansub progress tracker that exposes an API for groups to use. It goes alongside [ARX-7](https://github.com/IanMitchell/ARX-7) for usage on IRC. It's intended to serve multiple groups from one central host location.

## Getting Access

An official showtimes server is up and running in beta form; if you'd like access, please contact Desch on `irc.rizon.net`. You can find him in `#goodjob` or `#arx-7`.

Please be aware that Showtimes isn't officially released yet, and shouldn't be considered stable.

## Feature Roadmap

We're currently testing the initial implementation and updating it to allow greater flexibility, but eventually the following areas are planned for development.

1. **Wordpress Integration:** When a show is marked as released, it'd be nice to have a post automatically generated from a supplied template and submitted to a Wordpress blog.
2. **Automatic Show Import:** Each season, a list of new shows will be automatically imported to cut down on manual data entry.
3. **Website UI:** The current UI is more for debugging than actual usage. A real, usable UI would be nice to have.
